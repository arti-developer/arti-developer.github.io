            The domestic pigeon (Columba livia domestica) is a pigeon subspecies that was derived from the rock dove (also called the rock pigeon). The rock pigeon is the world's oldest domesticated bird. Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets mention the domestication of pigeons more than 5,000 years ago, as do Egyptian hieroglyphics.[2] Research suggests that domestication of pigeons occurred as early as 10,000 years ago

                King Pigeons are bred for food (squab). They are larger than both feral and homing pigeons, and are pure white with pink beaks. King Pigeons are sometimes bought and released by well-meaning individuals who “save” them from live animal markets. Unfortunately, King Pigeons face certain death in the wild since they do not have proper flight or survival skills. They do, however, make excellent pets and aviary residents. They are tame and accustomed to human contact.

            <h2> Racing and Homing Pigeons </h2>
             Homing pigeons can be a variety of colors, but are commonly blue (similar to wild pigeons), or white. These pigeons are raced competitively, used as wedding and event “doves,” or kept as pets. They are muscular and strong flyers with powerful homing instincts, and they are trained to return to their lofts after a race or event. Homers and racers do, however, get lost or injured. Because they are banded, you can often trace their ownership by the information on the band. Occasionally, a lost homing pigeon will assimilate into a wild flock and you may see the occasional banded pigeon foraging with her wild mates.
